      <description>This article aims to present the steps required to create the minimum necessary infrastructure, to gain familiarity with, and test Red Hat Single Sign-On (SSO) and its integration with Microsoft Active Federation Services (ADFS) via the SAML protocol.
Most businesses usually have a large Windows estate and therefore use Active Directory (AD) as it provides a single source of user management in the organisation. Many organizations often incorporate additional authentication programs and protocols in tandem with AD, including RH-SSO for example.</description>

The &amp;lsquo;spark&amp;rsquo; that kicked this idea off was part of an aspiration to first get the Prometheus node exporter for the core machine metrics running on SPARC tin for Solaris 11.3, then potentially other node exporters such as the JMX exporter and a Oracle DB exporter.
Note: Oracle announced Go version 1.7.6 will be available in Solaris 11.</description>

The main reason I have put this site together is to better understand the things I do by forcing myself to document things better. I'm hoping these such things may also be useful to other people.. such as you... the reader of my blog!

This site is very much still in its infancy. I do plan to add things such as comment sections and a way in which you could contact me... but for now, it is what it is.

This site was created with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) using the theme [Diary](https://github.com/amazingrise/hugo-theme-diary) by [Rise](https://amazingrise.net) ported from [Makitos](https://mak1t0.cc/) Hexo theme [Journal](https://github.com/SumiMakito/hexo-theme-journal/).
